/**
 * You can sort objects that you create. Java provides an interface called Comparable .
 * If your class implements Comparable , it can be used in these data structures that require
 * comparison. There is also a class called Comparator , which is used to specify that you want
 * to use a different order than the object itself provides.
 * 
 * Comparable and Comparator are similar enough to be tricky. The exam likes to see if
 * it can trick you into mixing up the two. Donâ€™t be confused! In this section, we will dis-
 * cuss Comparable first. Then, as we go through Comparator , we will point out all of the
 * differences.
