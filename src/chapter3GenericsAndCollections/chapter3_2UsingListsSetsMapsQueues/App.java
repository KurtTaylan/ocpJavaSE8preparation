/**
 * In this chapter we are going to see about Collections in Java APIs
 * 
 * A collection is a group of objects contained in a single object. The Java Collections
 * Framework is a set of classes in java.util for storing collections. There are four main
 * interfaces in the Java Collections Framework:
 * 
 * -List  : A list is an ordered collection of elements that allows duplicate entries. Elements
 *        in a list can be accessed by an int index.
 *         
 * -Set   : A set is a collection that does not allow duplicate entries.
 * 
 * -Queue : A queue is a collection that orders its elements in a specific order for processing.
 *        A typical queue processes its elements in a first-in, first-out order, but other orderings
 *        are possible.
 *         
 * -Map   : A map is a collection that maps keys to values, with no duplicate keys allowed.
 *        The elements in a map are key/value pairs.
 *        
 *
