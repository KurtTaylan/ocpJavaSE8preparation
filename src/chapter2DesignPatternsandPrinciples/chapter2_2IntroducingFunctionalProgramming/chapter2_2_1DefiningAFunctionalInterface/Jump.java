//	Applying the @FunctionalInterface Annotation
	
//	While it is a good practice to mark a functional interface with the @FunctionalInterface
//	annotation for clarity, it is not required with functional programming. The Java compiler
//	implicitly assumes that any interface that contains exactly one abstract method is
//	a functional interface. Conversely, if a class marked with the @FunctionalInterface
//	annotation contains more than one abstract method, or no abstract methods at all, then
//	the compiler will detect this error and not compile.
//	One problem with not always marking your functional interfaces with this annotation is
//	that another developer may treat any interface you create that has only one method as
//	a functional interface. If you later modify the interface to have other abstract methods,
//	suddenly their code will break since it will no longer be a functional interface.
//	Therefore, it is recommend that you explicitly mark the interface with the
//	@FunctionalInterface annotation so that other developers know which interfaces they
//	can safely apply lambdas to without the possibility that they may stop being functional
//	interfaces down the road.
//	The exam writers arenâ€™t likely to use this annotation, as they expect you to be able to
//	determine whether an interface is a functional interface on your own.
	/** 
	 * In a result does not matter if interface specify static method or default method ,
	 * or extends another interface as long as interface has only one abstract method , 
	 * it assumes to be functional interface.
