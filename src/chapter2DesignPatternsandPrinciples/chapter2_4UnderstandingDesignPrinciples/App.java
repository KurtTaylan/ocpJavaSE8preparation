/**
 * A design principle is an established idea or best practice that facilitates the software design
 * process.
 *  
 *  In this section, we will discuss design principles for creating Java classes and why
 * those principles lead to better and more manageable code bases. In general, following good
 * design principles leads to
 * 
 * ■ More logical code
 * ■ Code that is easier to understand
 * ■ Classes that are easier to reuse in other relationships and applications
 * ■ Code that is easier to maintain and that adapts more readily to changes in the
 * application requirements
