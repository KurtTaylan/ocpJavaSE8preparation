/**
 * A design pattern is an established general solution to a commonly occurring software
 * development problem. The purpose of a design pattern is to leverage the wealth of
 * knowledge of developers who have come before you in order to solve old problems that
 * you may encounter easily. It also gives developers a common vocabulary in which they can
 * discuss common problems and solutions. For example, if you say that you wrote getters/
 * setters or implemented the singleton pattern, most developers will understand the structure
 * of your code without having to get into the low‚Äêlevel details.
 * 
 * while OCP exam is just gonna show 'Creational' design pattern group 
 * it is focusing on only 2 patterns;
 * 1-Singleton pattern 
 * 2-Immutable object pattern (This is not actually fully some pattern but sub-term I am guessing.)
 * 
 * Of course we gonna see 2 other patterns in 'Creational' group ;
 * 3-Builder pattern
 * 4-Factory pattern
 * 
 * In GoF(1994): There are 23 design patterns in 3 different 'situations'.
 * 
 * -Creational
 * -Structural
 * -Behavioral 
 * 
 * In creational there are 5 of design patterns;
 * 1-Singleton
 * 2-Prototype
 * 3-Builder
 * 4-Factory
 * 5-Abstract Factory
 * 
 * 
 * Its last 4 is not gonna be in exam but still I am gonna tell them here for to learn;
 * They are handling lots of cases while we are creating our Data Model :)
