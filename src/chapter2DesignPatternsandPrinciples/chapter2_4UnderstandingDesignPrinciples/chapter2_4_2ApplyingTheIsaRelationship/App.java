/**
 * In Chapter 1, you were introduced to the instanceof operator and shown how it could
 * be used to determine when an object is an instance of a particular class, superclass, or
 * interface. In object‐oriented design, we describe the property of an object being an instance
 * of a data type as having an is‐a relationship.
 * 
 * The is‐a relationship is also known as the inheritance test.
 * 
 * The fundamental result of the is‐a principle is that if A is‐a B, then any instance of A can
 * be treated like an instance of B.
 * 
 * This holds true for a child that is a subclass of any parent,
 * be it a direct subclass or a distant child. As we discussed with polymorphism, objects can
 * take many different forms.
