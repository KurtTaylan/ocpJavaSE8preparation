/**
 * A static nested class is a static
 * class defined at the member level. It can be instantiated without an object of the
 * enclosing class, so it canâ€™t access the instance variables without an explicit object of
 * the enclosing class.
 * 
 * -The nesting creates a namespace because the enclosing class name must be used to refer
 *  to it.
 *  
 * -It can be made private or use one of the other access modifiers to encapsulate it.
 * 
 * -The enclosing class can refer to the fields and methods of the static nested class.
