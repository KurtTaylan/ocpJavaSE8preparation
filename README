Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 8 preparation examples.

Pre-Notes: 

-This project is in more documentary taste rather then to being hard code.

-You can keep track this project and just go to exam :) I aimed this project to be enough
to teach you what is going on OCP 8 exam and you can easily prepare for exam by this project.
 
-I am trying to keep project simple in every manner, to read,understand,integrate. In this manner,
I did not create this project by maven package tool which is awesome if you do not know that yet.
 
-I am going to keep edit this project as long as I am preparing for exam.
However,If you are thinking I am doing wrong at somewhere or you cannot understand etc. just let me know 
so we can learn together :) 

-- My main notes going to be at codes, I am planning use this field for special notes or 
something I am thinking it is important for mention or you need to know about chapters or anything :) 

Happy Coding :)
